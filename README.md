This is an extension for Drive Badger. It provides `exclude.list` file, containing a list of exclusions compatible with popular `rsync` program.

The purpose of these exclusions is to decrease the amount of data to be exfiltrated by Drive Badger, and thus to speed up the attack,
by eliminating files and directories, that are not valuable in any way to the attacker:

- multimedia files (avi/mkv/rmvb movies, mp3/flac music)
- game directories
- image files containing encrypted filesystems
- Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird caches
- Microsoft WIM archives
- Windows search telemetry

### Installing

Clone this repository as `/opt/drivebadger/config/exclude-user` directory on your Drive Badger persistent partition.
